# Play-with-Snake
Here u can Play with Snake if u are boring in free time.
This is simply a snake game which is built using simple HTML, CSS and little bit javascript
Here first we have set the background and after that we have place a box(Named as board) in which our snake will move
Then we have divided the board into 18 parts so that the board can become grid of 18*18 and each part is of 1 unit. We can divide the grid into any no. of parts
Then we have simply applied the JavaScript to show the food and to generate the food randomly if the snake had eaten the food. We have also decided the initial position of snake,
The to feel beeter while playing we have also added the music sound
Also we have added the score And Hiscore to show the current score and the hishscore.
We have use the local stroage of browser to save our previous high score.
Clone the repo and enjoy the game.
Thank You
